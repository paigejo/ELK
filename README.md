# ELK
Extended LatticeKrig. Generalizes the LatticeKrig framework to the more flexible latent Gaussian model (LGM) context, allowing it to be fit to non-Gaussian data.  This is a Bayesian implementation requiring the INLA package.  See also: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LatticeKrig/index.html and http://www.r-inla.org/.
